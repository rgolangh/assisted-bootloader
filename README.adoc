Assisted Bootloader

To keep lowering the bar for installing a cluster, the assisted installer supplied a custom ISO to boot 
a machine with the target cluster relevant bits in its ignition and rootfs.
The oppurtunity to cut this even further is to make a more generic booting tool that can be pointed at any 
cluster endpoint (the InfraEnv object) and pull the boot artifacts directly from it. 
As more cloud providers looking for a way to add nodes using their infra, every one with its set of features
and limitation (like no boot from ISO, or limited or non-direct user-data support), a search for more 
decoupled and streamlined way to add any machine to a cluster is important.

This effort has 2 main artifacts: 1. an init program that runs after the kernel boots(built using u-root) and 2. a raw, bootable ~60M disk image.

Bootloading sequence:
- bake an assisted-bootloader image with the target infra-env (for fully automated installation). 
- boot a node with a disk created from that image (large enough for a full worker install)
- assisted-bootloader programs starts with infra-env-id and token arguments
- parse the iPXE script of the infra-env
- download kernel, initrd, and cmdline from infra-env
- kexec into the kernel and initrd 
- normal assisted flow with the agent takes place


To create a complete initramfs using the u-root fork:

    make initrd

To produce the disk image

    make disk-image

To use the image locally, for exlopration and dev:

    make run-vm
