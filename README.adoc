Assisted Bootloader
-------------------

To keep lowering the bar for installing a cluster,the assisted installer supplied a custom ISO to boot
a machine with the target cluster relevant bits in its ignition and rootfs.
The oppurtunity to cut this even further is to make a more generic booting tool that can be pointed at any
cluster endpoint (the InfraEnv object) and pull the boot artifacts directly from it. 
As more cloud providers looking for a way to add nodes using their infra, every one with its set of features
and limitation (like no boot from ISO, or limited or non-direct user-data support), a search for more 
decoupled and streamlined way to add any machine to a cluster is important.

This effort has 2 main artifacts:
 - an init program that runs after the kernel boots(built using u-root) and
 - a raw, bootable, ~60M disk image.

Bootloading sequence
--
* boot a node with a disk created from that image (large enough for a full worker install)
* assisted-bootloader programs starts with infra-env-id and token arguments
* parses the iPXE script of the infra-env
* downloads kernel, initrd, and cmdline from infra-env
* `kexec` into the kernel and initrd
* normal assisted flow with the agent takes place

To create a complete initramfs using the u-root fork:
[source, bash]
make initrd

To produce the disk image:
[source, bash]
make disk-image

To use the image locally, for exlopration and dev:
[source, bash]
make run-vm
